Description:

    Let cron use notify-send command.

    By default cron does not have access to XDG_RUNTIME_DIR
    but needs it to use notify-send.

    This script saves XDG_RUNTIME_DIR to a file that can be
    sourced in cron scripts so that XDG_RUNTIME_DIR is defined.

    It can be executed in .bashrc safely.

    Then, add these lines to a cron script:

    xdg_runtime_var="$HOME/bin/xdg_runtime_var"
    if [[ -r "$xdg_runtime_var" ]]; then
       source "$xdg_runtime_var"
    fi


Example:

    find_xdg_runtime_var

    find_xdg_runtime_var doc
      Show this documentation


Input:

    find_xdg_runtime_var [doc]


Output:

    The file path where the value of the var is saved.


Side effects:

     Creates file: $HOME/bin/xdg_runtime_var
