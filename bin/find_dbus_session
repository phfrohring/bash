Description:

    Let cron use notify-send command.

    By default cron does not have access to DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS
    but needs it to use notify-send.

    This script saves DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS to a file that can be
    sourced in cron scripts so that DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS is defined.

    It can be executed in .bashrc safely.

    Then, add these lines to a cron script:

    dbus_session_bus_address_var="$HOME/bin/dbus_session_bus_address_var"
    if [[ -r "$dbus_session_bus_address_var" ]]; then
       source "$dbus_session_bus_address_var"
    fi


Example:

    find_dbus_session_bus_address

    find_dbus_session_bus_address doc
      Show this documentation


Input:

    find_dbus_session_bus_address [doc]


Output:

    File path where the variable is saved.


Side effects:

     Creates file: $HOME/bin/dbus_session_bus_address_var
