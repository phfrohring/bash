* Why and what

  Shell scripts are everywhere and working with them can be challenging.  Let's try to
  make shell scripting saner by accumulating knowledge here.


* How

  Scripts written using these [[file:mod/][models]]:

    - fail as soon as a command fails to guard against failure escalation
    - print error messages telling what went wrong, in which script, when and the
      command that failed to help identify problems.
    - offer a way to step trough commands
    - they prevent undefined variables to be used to guard against things like ~rm -r
      $undefined/~ getting understood by ~bash~ as: ~rm -r /~
    - offer a way to clean the state of the program after exit and even after an error
    - are relocatable i.e. independent from a given filesystem i.e. you can install
      them anywhere
    - interpreter can be specified at install time which makes them usable on more
      systems
    - â€¦

  Workflow:

    1. need a new script
    2. copy/paste ./mod/script_model
    3. implement using ./lib/*
